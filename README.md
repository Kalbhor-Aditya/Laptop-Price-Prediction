# Laptop Price Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project is about predicting laptop prices based on various features. The model was trained using the RandomForestRegressor algorithm and achieved a maximum accuracy of **89%**.

## Model
The RandomForestRegressor model was chosen due to its ability to handle complex datasets with high dimensionality, and its robustness against overfitting. The model was trained and tested on a dataset containing various laptop features, and it achieved a maximum accuracy of **89%**.

## Deployment
The model is deployed on a web application built with Streamlit. Streamlit is a fast, user-friendly, and interactive tool that allows us to easily deploy machine learning models.

## Usage
To use the application, simply input the features of the laptop and the model will predict its price. The application is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for anyone to use.

## Future Work
In the future, I am planning to improve the model's performance by experimenting with other algorithms and tuning hyperparameters. I also plan to update the web application with more features for a better user experience and will soon deploy it.
